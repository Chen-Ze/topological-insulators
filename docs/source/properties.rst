Physical Properties of Topological Insulators
======================================================

Helical Spin Polarization
-----------------------------

* Electron spins of topological surface states lies in the plane :math:`(k_x, k_y)`.
* Electron spins are perpendicular to :math:`\vb{k}`.
* Electrons hold helicity.
  
  * In particular, a Kramers pair consists of :math:`(\vb{k},\vb{\sigma})` and :math:`(-\vb{k},-\vb{\sigma})`, i.e. they hold the same helicity.
* Degeneracy at Dirac point protected by TRS.
* TIs known as of 2014 are left-handed for Fermi levels above the Dirac point and right-handed below.

.. warning::
    It seems that the definition of helicity here is a little bit different than that in particle physics.

Quasiparticle Interference
-------------------------------

* Quasiparticle interference: If :math:`\vb{k}_1` is scattered to :math:`\vb{k}_2`, then these two states may interfere with each other and change the charge density.
* Spin is preserved during scattering by non-magnetic centers. Therefore, in scattering of topological surface states, scattering of the form :math:`\vb{k} \rightarrow -\vb{k}` are forbidden due to spin polarization.
* In :math:`\ce{Bi2Te3}` where the Dirac cone is replaced a complex :math:`C_6` shape, scattering is not limited to :math:`\vb{k} \rightarrow -\vb{k}` and therefore quasiparticle interference is observable.
